Documentation:

With great pleasure I bring you my CS50 final project documentation. This project is meant to be a web program in which users can log in and find out more about their recommended daily water intake. Users are able to create accounts, log in and out at will, and whist logged in, able to find out about why they should drink more water, find out how much water they should be drinking, and able to log their water intake to keep track of their intake.

In order to start the web, simply run 'flask run' on the terminal window (making sure the hydration directiory is running via "cd hydration). This should open up the flask application that runs my html and python tabs. Once the flask application is up and running, click on the link provided on the terminal window to open up the web program.

You should now be presented with hyDration's login page. Chances are you don't have a current account, but that's okay! One can create an account via the register tab. Once there, you can log in with a username and create a password you'll remember. Once done, you'll be directed back to the login page. Log in with your username and password.

Once in, you can explore the features hyDration has to offer. Notice that you can scroll down to the features or use the navigation bar to take you to those features. Let's focus on the water calculator. The calculator asks 3 simple phisiological questions about the user. Once the user inputs the necessary info, they'll get a recommended water recommendation. Such a formula was derived from https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/7-health-benefits-of-water. Once you get this recommendation, it's important to act on it by keeping track of how much water you drink in a day. That is where the logging of the water feature comes in handy. The log feature allows users to see how much water they've drunk and allows them to add ounces of water and records the timestamp of when it was drunk. This comes in keeping track of the water and ultimately reaching your new known water goals. Since water intake resets by the day, a user can click on the "New Day" button to reset the log and bring the total ounces for that day back to 0.

Once done with using the web program, the user can click on more information to get more info via the "healthline" website and know the importance of drinking more water on a daily basis. Once the user is satisfied with their experience, they can log out and close the web application. The log out feature is found at the very bottom of the landing page.

That sums up the features my website allows users to do. Overall, the goal is to get users more aware about their water consumption and get them drinking more water to satsify their daily intake.
